We'll put this into practice by adding more visual elements to the main screen.  Add a text entry field and 'send' button to your main activity, as in the Android training example. The text field should have fixed spacing to the left edge of the screen and to the button on it's right. Field width should vary according to screen size. The button should have fixed spacing on it's right to the screen edge. Add a 2 x 2 grid of buttons below the text entry field. For now, button text is your choice, but should be unique for each. The left edge of the grid should be aligned with the text field, and right edge should be aligned with the 'send' button. Spacing between each column of buttons should vary according to screen size,  Enable each button with a click event, where tapping the button displays a 'toast' specific to that button.   UI elements should be fully visible on a range of phone screen sizes.
